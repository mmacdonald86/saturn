Release 0.5.3
-------------
- SvrModel gets new public method 'has_model'.
- Move Docker image definition out of the repo.

Release 0.5.2
-------------
- SvrModel expects a CatalogModel whose tag consists of adgroup-id only (no brand-id).

Release 0.5.1
-------------
- Read in an optional plain text file that specifies S curve parameters for testing purposes.

Release 0.5.0
-------------
- Use a 'S'-shaped curve for the quantile-multiplier conversion.
- Allow dynamic determination of the curve shape based on pacing, which is a new, optional argument.

Release 0.4.0
-------------
- Remove the temporary short-cut introduced in version 0.3.3.
- `SvrModel::run` requires additional argument `adgroup_id`, supporting
  two tags (brand_id and adgroup_id) in the CatalogModel, hence
  supporting testing multiple versions of models in the same brand
  (to some extent).

Release 0.3.3
-------------
- Support default SVR per brand for non-LBA and LBA -1 traffic.
- Implement a temporary short-cut to support upcoming test.

Release 0.3.2
-------------
- Change multiplier logic for -1 traffic: if don't want to bid, the logic is in Neptune; otherwise,
  provides a brand-aware appropriately small multiplier, yet to be implemented.

Release 0.3.1
-------------
- Remove build script for Neptune
- Minor change to `SvrModel`: user-level SVR prediction is treated as random if not found

Release 0.2.0
-------------
- Change to SvrModel internals
- Upgrade to `mars` 0.3.0, which has header files re-org

Release 0.1.0
-------------
- Simplified and forward-looking API for mars called saturn
- FeatureEngine with feature list as part of class
- SvrModel
- Benchmark program for SvrModel
