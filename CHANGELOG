Release 0.4.0
-------------
- Remove the temporary short-cut introduced in version 0.3.3.
- `SvrModel::run` requires additional argument `adgroup_id`, supporting
  two tags (brand_id and adgroup_id) in the CatalogModel, hence
  supporting testing multiple versions (to some extent) of models
  in the same brand.

Release 0.3.3
-------------
- Support default SVR per brand for non-LBA and LBA -1 traffic.
- Implement a temporary short-cut to support upcoming test.

Release 0.3.2

  provides a brand-aware appropriately small multiplier, yet to be implemented.

Release 0.3.1
-------------
- Remove build script for Neptune
- Minor change to `SvrModel`: user-level SVR prediction is treated as random if not found

Release 0.2.0

- Upgrade to `mars` 0.3.0, which has header files re-org

Release 0.1.0
